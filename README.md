# Hard-Real-Time-Operating-System-Kernel
Minimal hard real-time OS kernel in C11 (userspace simulation on Linux). Features fixed-priority preemptive scheduling (Rate Monotonic), priority-inheritance mutexes, static memory with stack canaries, deadline monitoring, watchdog, and fault logging. Includes formal analysis and timing comparison. Focused on deterministic real-time behavior.
